# Automatic parcel tracking from e-mail (IMAP → USPS)

Companion guide for [`track_parcels_from_email.yaml`](track_parcels_from_email.yaml): watch your mailbox(es) for shipping e-mails, extract the USPS tracking code, and register it with `usps.track_parcel` — fully automatic, no extra custom component required.

USPS is a **code-based** carrier: it has no account inbox, so every parcel must be registered by its tracking code before the integration can follow it. This recipe automates exactly that step.

**How it works, in one line:** the core [IMAP integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/imap/) fires an `imap_content` event for every new e-mail (including the body); the automation extracts the tracking code — a cheap regex first, an optional AI fallback for everything else — and calls `usps.track_parcel`.

```
new e-mail ──imap_content──▶ automation ──▶ regex match? ──▶ usps.track_parcel
                                     │
                                     └──▶ no match, but looks like a shipping mail
                                          ──▶ ai_task.generate_data (optional)
                                              ──▶ tracking code
```

## Prerequisites

- This integration, with the `usps.track_parcel` action available (field `tracking_code`).
- The core **IMAP** integration (ships with Home Assistant, no HACS needed).
- *(Optional but recommended)* an **AI Task** entity (e.g. Anthropic/Claude, Google, OpenAI) for the fallback path. Without it, simply delete the `else:` block — the regex path works standalone.

## Step 1 — IMAP entries

Add **Settings → Devices & services → Add integration → IMAP** for every account you want to watch:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Server | `imap.gmail.com` (Gmail) — mind the hostname, it is **not** `imap.google.com` |
| Port | `993` |
| Username | your address |
| Password | see the Gmail note below |
| Charset | `utf-8` |
| Folder | `INBOX` (or a label/subfolder — see below) |

Then open the entry's **Configure** (options) and set:

- **Message data to include in the event**: enable **text** (the automation needs the body!)
- **Max message size**: raise it to `30000` — carrier mails are long and the default cuts them off before the tracking code appears.
- *search*: `UnSeen UnDeleted` works, but **scoping it to the carrier's sender is recommended** — see [Scope & privacy](#scope--privacy) below. Keep *push* enabled (IMAP IDLE → events arrive within seconds).

**Multiple mailboxes / accounts:** each IMAP entry is one account × folder combination. Add the same account again with a different folder to watch labels (Gmail labels appear as IMAP folders). All entries fire the *same* `imap_content` event, so **one automation covers all of them**.

**Gmail note:** since May 2025 Google blocks plain-password IMAP logins ("less secure apps"). Use an **app password** instead (requires 2-step verification): <https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords>.

## Scope & privacy

By default this recipe is broad. The core IMAP integration fires an
`imap_content` event — **including the full message body** — for *every* new
mail its *search* matches, and the automation reacts to **all** of those events.
With the default `search: UnSeen UnDeleted` that means every incoming e-mail
runs through the automation's templates, and — if you keep the AI fallback —
every mail passing the keyword gate has up to 6000 characters of its body sent
to your AI Task, **possibly a cloud model**.

None of that data leaves through *this* integration — it only exposes the
`track_parcel` action. The mailbox access and the event stream belong to Home
Assistant's **core IMAP integration**, using the username / app-password you
gave it — which grants full read access to your **entire** mailbox, not just
parcel mail. So it is worth narrowing what it ever sees.

Narrow it at the source (most effective first):

1. **Scope the IMAP `search` to the carrier's sender.** In the IMAP entry's
   options, e.g. `search: FROM "noreply@thecarrier.example" UNSEEN` (chain
   several with `OR`: `OR FROM "a@x" FROM "b@y" UNSEEN`). Only matching mail
   ever becomes an event, so the automation — and the AI — never see the rest.
2. **Or point the entry at a dedicated folder/label.** Add a server-side mail
   rule that files shipping notifications into e.g. a `Parcels` label, and set
   the IMAP entry's *Folder* to it. Same effect, and it survives sender changes
   better.
3. **Add a sender allowlist** as an extra automation `condition` — defense in
   depth if you keep a broad search.
4. **Drop the AI fallback** (delete the `else:` block) if you want *no* body
   text to leave Home Assistant; the regex path is fully local.

## Step 2 — the automation

Paste [`track_parcels_from_email.yaml`](track_parcels_from_email.yaml) and adapt the notify action, the keyword list and the AI entity to your setup.

### Tracking-code formats

The regex matches USPS's own tracking-number shapes rather than a short alpha
prefix — USPS has no stable one like some other carriers do:

```
(?<![0-9A-Za-z])(?:9\d{19}|9\d{21}|[A-Z]{2}\d{9}[A-Z]{2})(?![0-9A-Za-z])
```

Two shapes are covered: a 20- or 22-digit domestic IMpb code starting with
`9` (commonly `9400…`/`9205…`/`9270…`/`9407…`/`9500…`/`9303…`), and the
13-character international **S10** format (2 letters, 9 digits, 2-letter
country code, e.g. `LZ123456785US`). The integration itself accepts any code
matching `^[A-Z0-9]{6,30}$`, but matching *that* broadly against e-mail text
would hit every order number in the mail — so the example anchors on the real
shapes instead. **If your mails carry a different format, add it to the
alternation**; the AI fallback will surface unknown formats in the meantime.

### Design notes

- **Regex first, AI second.** Mails straight from the carrier match the regex and never touch the AI. The AI fallback earns its keep on the messy cases: forwarded mails, webshop confirmations, unfamiliar layouts.
- **Duplicates are harmless:** calling `track_parcel` twice for the same code is a no-op, and the `initial` condition already suppresses re-triggers of the same message.
- **`mode: queued`** so a burst of mails (mailbox sync) is processed one by one instead of being dropped.

## Pitfalls we hit so you don't have to

1. **Jinja eats backslashes in string literals.** A template stored as `regex_findall('\bEXAMPLE…')` silently becomes a **backspace character** (`\b` is a string escape), so the regex never matches — no error anywhere. That's why the pattern is backslash-free: `(?<![0-9A-Za-z])` lookarounds instead of `\b`, `[0-9]` instead of `\d`. Copy that style if you add a prefix.
2. **The `initial` event flag means the opposite of what you might expect.** In the IMAP integration `initial: true` = *first time this message is seen* (new mail); `false` = a duplicate trigger of the same message. So the condition must **require** `initial`, not exclude it.
3. **Raise the max message size.** With the default the body is truncated before the tracking code appears in most carrier mails. `30000` is plenty.
4. **Enable "text" in the event options.** Without it the event has headers only and there is nothing to extract.
5. **Gmail = app password.** Plain passwords stopped working on Google IMAP in May 2025; app passwords (with 2FA) are the supported route. And the host is `imap.gmail.com`.

## Testing without waiting for a real parcel

Fire a fake event and watch the automation trace (Settings → Automations → your automation → Traces):

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $HA_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  http://YOUR_HA:8123/api/events/imap_content \
  -d '{"sender":"noreply@uspsshipping.com","subject":"Your parcel is on its way",
       "text":"Tracking code: 9400111899223197428490","initial":true,"folder":"INBOX","username":"test"}'
```

Then `usps.untrack_parcel` the test code afterwards. For a full end-to-end test, forward a real shipping mail to the watched mailbox — it must arrive **unread**.
