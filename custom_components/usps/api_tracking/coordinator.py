"""Coordinator for the USPS parcel tracker integration.

Fetching and event firing only — the parcel mapping lives in :mod:`.parcels`.
Identical to the account-less variant's coordinator except for one thing: the
API key is a single credential shared by every tracked parcel, so a rejected
key (rotated or revoked outside Home Assistant) is a whole-poll condition, not
a per-parcel one — it must short-circuit into a reauth prompt rather than being
folded into the ordinary per-parcel error count below.
